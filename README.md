News Website


This is a student project of a news website/program that that displays news extracts of news and articles from other sites and links them for the user in case the extract interested them in reading further about it.

At this moment, not much functionality is to be found. The skeleton for the program is set up but the code has been mostly just fleshed out so far in the repository class, plus work has been done on the HTML/CSS for the mainpage.
