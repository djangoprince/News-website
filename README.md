News Website


This is a student project of a news website/program that that displays news extracts of news and articles from other sites and links them for the user in case the extract interested them in reading further about it.

Attention! To make the data base work, you need to have MYsql installed. You then need to add the fhruturdb file to a location that looks like this: C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\Data
Then you need to have access setup that has username: root, password:2021binniA and a local host of 3306. This is needed so the jdbc code below works in the repository.
"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/fhruturdb", "root", "2021binniA"
